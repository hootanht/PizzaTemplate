## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The HTML code represents a Pizza Shop website with various sections such as the header, pizza menu, order section, store locations, and a footer. The website is designed to showcase pizza offerings, allow users to add items to their cart, and provide information about store locations.

## 2. Header<a name="header"></a>

The header section contains a navigation menu with three items: "Order History," "Cs Pizza Delivery," and "My Cart." Each item is represented by a `<div>` element within an unordered list (`<ul>`).

            </li>

</header>
```

## 3. Pizza Menu<a name="pizza-menu"></a>

The pizza menu section displays multiple pizza cards, each containing an image, pizza details, size options, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. The pizza cards are organized in rows.

    <div class="pizza-first-row">
        <!-- Individual pizza cards (repeated for each pizza) -->
        <div class="pizza-card">
            <!-- Pizza details, image, size options, and price -->
        </div>
        <!-- ... Repeat for other pizza cards ... -->
    </div>

</div>
```

## 4. Order Section<a name="order-section"></a>

    <div class="our-location-container">
        <!-- Location details including address, contact numbers, and Facebook link -->
    </div>
    <!-- ... Repeat for additional store locations ... -->
